 MISSION RIDER GEAR FROM A RIDER, TO THE RIDERS

RIDERGEAR, is a new startup by PRABHU VEER, a passionate rider whose sole goal was bringing the best possible shopping experience to any rider who visits us online. It started up with an idea to fill his own biking wardrobe, but later started getting items for every friend, near and dear and now the whole country. 

RIDERGEAR is a new super bike accessories and safety gear pitstop for all the enthusiastic bikers and bikernis. You heard that right, we are also stocking items for bikernis, so our respected lady riders can also shop their collection. 

We are just a startup with limited resources and funding, so we are not stocking all the items right now. But whatever stock we get time to time, we will update them on our Facebook page and you may order it then.

 Items listed on the website once ordered and paid, it takes 15-18 days to get delivered to your doorsteps.

We have a special REQUEST A QUOTE  page, where you can send us a request for any product you need and we will get that for you.

We hope that you enjoy shopping with us now and in the future. 


 Sincerely, 

RIDER GEARTeam</em></h4></P>
